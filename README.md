# Motivation and Learning Objectives

The aim of the project is to code a very fun card game (variation of whist) that my friends and I created while travelling in India, 2012. 
The card game kept us entertained for hours on long train and bus rides, with the loser of the game often being required to do a forfeit.
Now that the 4 creators of the game all live in different countries, I thought it would be a lovely idea to get together online and play.

The project has been built with the JS full stack languages, using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.
The main challenge was the multiplayer nature of the game, where player 2 has to directly react to an action from player 1.
In order to achieve this, intially I have implemented a auto refresh every second, but I will implement websockets to make the experience smoother.

I hope that others find this game as entertaining as we did in 2012!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
